                            In physiotherapy, I developed diagnostic skills to identify problems, develop treatment
                            plans, and assess progress. Similarly, I use these skills to debug code, analyze system
                            requirements and design effective solutions.

                            Worked as part of multidisciplinary healthcare teams, requiring effective communication,
                            collaboration and multitasking. This prepared me to work in software development teams
                            with diverse roles and backgrounds.

                            These skills easily transferred to programming, working with APIs, debugging code, and
                            following software architecture.
