                    Full stack developer with experience in Angular, Java, Spring Boot, TypeScript, and Laravel.
                    I quickly integrate into new projects and teams, offering a different
                    perspective thanks to my background in physiotherapy. I stand out for my ability to communicate
                    complex technical concepts in a clear and accessible way, facilitating collaboration between
                    technical and non-technical teams. Always committed to continuous learning and delivering quality
                    code, which I now apply to full-stack development.
